# Tools

In order to not reinvent the wheel every time a project starts I keep this git submodule which contains mostly 
generic pieces of code such as patterns or simple tools used across different projects.

Sorry, but for now the documentation is still very incomplete.

Note: Any change made in this repository has to be done with the following thought in mind: once the submodule is updated the changes are automatically available to all dependent projects.
